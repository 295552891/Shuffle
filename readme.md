# Shuffle 2.0

This is a large improvement to shuffle. Most notably, the ability for [masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com) layouts. Other additions include adding/removing items, enabling/disabling, multiple instances on a page, and more!


## Improvements
* Use Deferred objects for callbacks
* Custom animations
* Horizontal layout
