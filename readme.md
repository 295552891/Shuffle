# Shuffle 2.0

This is a large improvement to shuffle. Most notably, the ability for [masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com) layouts. Other additions include adding/removing items, enabling/disabling, multiple instances on a page, and more!

## Todos
* Make demos
* Solve margin top issue
* init with a sort
* Horizontal layout
* Custom animations
* Consistent naming of public vs private functions
* Use Deferred objects for callbacks
