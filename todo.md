# Todos and other improvements

## Improvements
* TESTS!
* Use Deferred objects for callbacks
* Horizontal layout
* See if I can get Zepto.js working with it.
  * Find an alternative to jQuery's .data()
  * Find an alternative to jQuery's .outerWidth()
* Add bootstrap 3 grid demo.
* Use an enum for events?
* More JSDoc

## Things I don't like and would like to fix
* The `transition` method and the options object that it receives.
* Move everything to Shuffle.prototype.method = function.
* Make indentation 2 spaces instead of 4.
* `_layout` and `_placeItem`s parameters.
* `_setColumns` should be simpler
* Less jQuery dependency
