## Shuffle 2.0
This is a large improvement to shuffle. Most notably, the ability for [masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com) layouts. Other additions include adding/removing items, enabling/disabling, multiple instances on a page, and more!

## Running locally
This project uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
* Head over to [their quickstart guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) to setup jekyll.
* Install npm dependencies `npm install`.
* Run `grunt serve` to tell Jekyll to watch for changes.
* To watch for and compile changes to scss and shuffle src js files, run `grunt watch` in a separate tab.
* go to `http://localhost:4000` to see it.
