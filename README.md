## Shuffle 2.0
This is a large improvement to shuffle. Most notably, the ability for [masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com) layouts. Other additions include adding/removing items, enabling/disabling, multiple instances on a page, and more!

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) and [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/).
