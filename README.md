## Docs and Demos
[All found here](http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle)

## Shuffle 2.0
This is a large improvement to shuffle. Most notably, the ability for [masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com) layouts. Other additions include adding/removing items, enabling/disabling, multiple instances on a page, and more!

## Running locally
This project uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), so head over to [their quickstart guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) to get set up. You should then be able to run `jekyll serve --watch` and go to `http://localhost:4000/Shuffle` to see it.

## Improvements still to make
* Use Deferred objects for callbacks
* Horizontal layout
